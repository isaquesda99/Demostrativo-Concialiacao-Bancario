## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark maroon (#800000), derived from the image, for a serious, trustworthy institutional feel.
- Background color: Light tan (#F0E68C), a lighter desaturated version of the gold in the logo, providing a subtle contrast and warmth.
- Accent color: Soft gold (#D4AF37), analogous to the maroon and tan, but more saturated, to highlight important UI elements without being too intrusive.
- Font pairing: 'Literata' (serif) for body text, to give a literary feel, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for headlines. This combination will enhance readability and give an elegant look.
- Professional, clean layout emphasizing clarity and ease of use, typical for an institutional site. Use a grid system for structure.
- Use relevant, simple icons related to file uploading and financial comparison for clarity.
